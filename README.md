#**Aviation  Risk Analysis**

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to help a company identify low-risk aircraft models for commercial investment.

## *Business Understanding*
The company is entering the aviation market and wants to avoid high-risk aircraft. My analysis addresses:
- Which aircraft have the lowest accident and fatality rates?
- What are the most common causes of accidents?
- What recommendations can guide safe investment?

## *Data Understanding and Analysis*
*Source*: National Transportation Safety Board (1962â€“2023)  
*Description*: Civil aviation accidents, aircraft model, date, fatalities, accident cause, and more.

*Visualizations (will be added):*
1. Accidents per aircraft model
2. Fatalities over time
3. Top contributing factors to accidents

## * Conclusion*
- Aircraft X, Y, Z show the lowest risk
- Mechanical failure and pilot error are leading causes
- Company should invest in models with fewer accidents and high safety ratings
