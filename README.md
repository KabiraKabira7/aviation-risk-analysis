#**Aviation  Risk Analysis**

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to help a company identify low-risk aircraft models for commercial investment.

## *Business Understanding*
The company is entering the aviation market and wants to avoid high-risk aircraft. My analysis addresses:
- Which aircraft have the lowest accident and fatality rates?
- What are the most common causes of accidents?
- What recommendations can guide safe investment?

## *Data Understanding and Analysis*
*Source*: National Transportation Safety Board (1962â€“2023)  
*Description*: Civil aviation accidents, aircraft model, date, fatalities, accident cause extra.


*Visualizations (will be added):*
1. Accidents per aircraft model
2. Fatalities over time
3. Top contributing factors to accidents

## * Conclusion*
- Companies such as PHANTOM,GREG HOBBS,JAMES R DERNOVSEK,ORLICAN SRO LEON E EVERETT among others had the lowest number of accidents with one case each over the duration under consideration(1962-2023).On the other hand,piper had the highest number of accidents per aircraft make with 5559 cases,beech(2880 cases),CEESNA(2158 cases) took the top three companies with highest number of fatalities between the year 1962 to 2023.
- Mechanical failure and pilot error are leading causes
- Company should invest in models with fewer accidents and high safety ratings

##*Recommendations Based on Aviation Accident Data Analysis*
*1. Aircraft Type Selection*
-Based on accident rates, Boeing 737, Airbus A320, and Cessna 172 show lower accident frequencies.
-Prioritize acquisition of aircraft types with proven safety records to minimize accident risks.
*2. Risk Mitigation Strategies*
*Common accident causes identified:*
-Pilot error
-Mechanical failure
-Adverse weather conditions
*Recommendations:*
-Invest in advanced pilot training and weather navigation skills.
-Choose aircraft with a record of mechanical reliability.
-Implement strict weather-related flight operation protocols.
*3. Safety and Fatality Minimization8
-Lower average fatalities observed in models like Airbus A320 and Bombardier CRJ.
*Recommendation:*
- Prefer newer aircraft with better crashworthiness and advanced safety features.
*Further Recommendations*
-Continuous Safety Monitoring: Regularly analyze updated flight and maintenance data.
-Predictive Maintenance: Adopt predictive maintenance systems to prevent mechanical issues.
-Fleet Modernization: Gradually replace older models with newer, safer aircraft.
-Data-Driven Decisions: Use real-time operational data to guide fleet and safety policies.
